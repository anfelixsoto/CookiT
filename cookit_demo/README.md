## Description 

Are you home and do not know what to cook or too lazy to go buy food? Do not sweat it! CookiT is here to help, CookiT allows you to enter a list of ingredients and give you a recipe or a list of recipes to make! Let's get started!

## Model User

A user is able to login or create an account. A user is able to enter a list of ingredients that are aviable to them. Using a third party API, Recipe - Food - Nutrition by Spponacular, to return recipes that can be created. Once a user is done cooking, they will have the option to upload a picture of their food. The post will then be shown to other users within the community. All post will have a button to 'CookiT' or 'Next Time'. Upon clicking on 'CookiT', the user will be linked into the recipe and they can start to cook! Users also have a user screen where they are able to see all their post and add another post, it they forgot to upload a picture; as well as, deleting post. Within the user screen, a user is able to locate their favorite list and start to cook any favorite recipes without having to look for it again.

All user data is stored in Firebase. Very basic rule to allow users to read and write into the delete database.

Application was developed in Flutter. Coding language: Dart.
